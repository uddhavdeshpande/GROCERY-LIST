When this code is compiled it gives otions known as
1)make a new changes int the database.
2)purchase items from the database.
3)generate the final bill.
4)exit the list.

REGARDING THE FIRST OPTION. 
	In this if we select the 1st option , their we get three options
	1.add new item in the database.
	2.display all items in the database.
	3.exit the list.
	Where in the first option we have to enter the name of the item ,its mrp and also it quantity.
If we select the second option than the list of the items are displayed which are already in the database.
The third option is used to exit the code.
	
REGARDING THE SECOND OPTION
	When the customer comes to buy any item in the database select the second option (purchase item) and than select the serial number of the item the customers wants to buy and than as we select the item the quantity in the database will automatically decrease.

REGARDING THE THIRD OPTION
	When the customer has finished selecting from the database than select the third option to generate the final bill.
	
I have used two structures and files to write the code.
	
	THANK YOU.
